For developing the flow field 5000 time steps are enough.
For time-averaging the flow field, 2000 time steps are ok. When you restart for averaging, set -rstart_turbinerotation as 1 and rename TurbineTorqueControlxxxxx1_000.dat as TurbineTorqueControl000001_000.dat. 

For Post-processing,you have to run ReadSaveCp.mcr, then copy the the Cp in CP.txt to CP_VWiS.dat. Now the layout file is ready to view.
